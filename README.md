# Dinner Time
> A resource for helping find meals to cook for dinner _(or really any meal)_

Dinner Time is a recipe storage and retrieval API made to make meal planning easier. I am currently overhauling the implementation so it is a major work in progress. The inspiration for creating it came from my family's weekly ritual of trying to figure out what meals to cook each night of the week and what ingredients we would need for each of them. This whole process takes a long time, and so I figured why not automate the whole thing.

## ðŸ™Œ Planned Features
- Add meals to a database
- Get specific meal recomendations or query for one meal at a time
- Get a menu and shopping list for the next X days
- Smart recommendation and menu creation using data about each recipe

##  ðŸ”¨ Stack
- PostgreSQL
- Typescript
- Express
- Heroku
- Github

You can take a look at the [API Docs](https://github.com/duncangrubbs/dinner-time/blob/master/docs/api.md) as well as the [Meal object specification](https://github.com/duncangrubbs/dinner-time/blob/master/docs/spec.md). Contributions are always welcome!
